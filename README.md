# Project Setup

This README provides instructions to set up and run both the backend and frontend of the project.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn installed

## Setup and Run

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## Notes
- Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend to avoid API connection issues.
